# ToDo project

The goal of this project is to build out a ToDo app with frontends and backend APIs using different technologies as I learn and grow.  

# Frontends:

* [React with Redux/TypeScript/Hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-react-redux)


# Backends: 

* [Rails API PostgresSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/rails-todo-api)
