# ToDo project

The goal of this project is to build out a ToDo app with frontends and backend APIs using different technologies as I learn and grow.  

# Frontends:

* [React with Redux/Thunk/TypeScript/Hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-react-redux)
* [React with Redux/Sagas/TypeScript/Hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-react-redux-saga)


# Backends: 

* [Rails API PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/rails-todo-api)
* [Express API PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-express-api)
