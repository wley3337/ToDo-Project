# ToDo project

The goal of this project is to build out a ToDo app with frontends and backend APIs using different technologies as I learn and grow.  

# Frontends:

* [React with Redux/Sagas/TypeScript/Hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-react-redux-saga) <-- use this one when spinning up the backend as it is the most complete (error displaying to user still to come.). 
* [React with Redux/Thunk/TypeScript/Hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-react-redux) <-- this is partial (only has login, account and list create )


# Backends: 

* [Rails API PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/rails-todo-api)
* [Express API PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-express-api) <--- still need to add db migration and creation
* [Python (Flask) API PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/todo-python-api)
